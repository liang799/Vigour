## Rules
### Branch
* We will be using topic branches:
  * Never modify `main` branch directly
  * For every new feature, add a new branch: `name/feature`
  * After you have finish implementing the feature, merge it
  * Delete the `name/feature` branch
 * Only modify your branch
 * If you wish to modify another team member's branch let them know so that they can `git fetch` instead of `git pull`
* Commit often. Do not change/add over 80 files and commit.
